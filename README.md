# Shotgun-EDA
A function that I use to get a quick feel for the data in any dataset.

The function combines common functions from Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplot to shoot out some general concepts about the input data. I use this so I don't have to constantly type out the same commands anytime I want to get a quick overview of a dataset. Usually after using this function I continue with a deeper dive into EDA.
